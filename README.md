# Support Vector Machines (SVM) Playground

## Overview

This repository serves as an educational purpose, learning and breaking down Support Vector Machines (SVM) in scikit-learn. In the notebooks we use SVMs to classify the iris dataset and the moons dataset (found in sklearn.datasets). Also we break down SVMs and get under the hood.

## Contents

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with hands-on examples, tutorials, and experiments.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts demonstrating SVM implementation and usage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zane-dev16/ML-Regression-Notebooks.git
    ```
2. Run the notebooks in your preferred order on any compatible platform
